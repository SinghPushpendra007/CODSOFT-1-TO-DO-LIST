DOMAIN: Python Programming

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

Purpose of the Project
Creating a to-do list using Python is a great way to enhance your programming skills while building a practical application. A simple to-do list can be implemented using basic data structures like lists or dictionaries.

To start, you can create a menu-driven program that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. For instance, you can use a list to store tasks, where each task is a string. The user can input tasks through the console, and you can implement functions for each operation.

Here's a basic outline of the program:

Add Task: Prompt the user to enter a task and append it to the list.
View Tasks: Display all tasks in the list.
Delete Task: Allow the user to specify a task to remove.
You can enhance the program by adding features like saving tasks to a file, setting deadlines, or prioritizing tasks. This project not only helps in learning Python but also results in a useful tool for personal organization.
